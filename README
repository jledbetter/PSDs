Comments
- The course home should have course description + course logo + organizer info + activity stream (updates from the course community). There was also the suggestion to add a drag-and-drop list of tasks, to be organized by the course organizer. These tasks are related to the syllabus and weekly planning. - João

- Each school should have its own layout. - João
